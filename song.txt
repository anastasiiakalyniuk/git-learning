[Verse 1: Jungkook]
You say love is messed up
You say that it don't work
You don't wanna try, no, no
(You don't wanna try, no, no)
And baby, I'm no stranger
To heartbreak and the pain of
Always being let go (Always being let go)

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, RM]
And I know there's no makin' this right, this right (This right)
And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Your mind)
But we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh yeah)
So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time

[Chorus: Jungkook, RM]
Waste it on me, waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Baby, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
